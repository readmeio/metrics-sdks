With [ReadMe's Metrics API](https://readme.com/metrics) your team can get deep insights into your API's usage. If you're a developer, it takes a few small steps to send your API logs to [ReadMe](http://readme.com). Here's an overview of how the integration works:

- You add the Cloudflare Worker to your Cloudflare account
- The Cloudflare Worker sends ReadMe the details of your API's incoming requests and outgoing responses, with the option for you to redact any private parameters or headers.
- ReadMe uses these request and response details to create an API Metrics Dashboard which can be used to analyze specific API calls or monitor aggregate usage data.

**For information on how to set it up, check out our [integration documentation](https://docs.readme.com/docs/sending-logs-to-readme-with-cloudflare).**
