## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile

`gem "readme-metrics"`

## Usage

`Readme::Metrics` is a Rack middleware and is compatible with all Rack-based
apps, including Rails.

When configuring the middleware, you must provide a block to tell the
middleware how to get values for the current user. These may be values taken
from the environment, or you may hardcode them.

If you're using Warden-based authentication like Devise, you may fetch the
current_user for a given request from the environment.

### Batching requests

By default, the middleware will batch requests to the ReadMe API in groups of 10.
For every 10 requests made to your application, the middleware will make a
single request to ReadMe. If you wish to override this, provide a
`buffer_length` option when configuring the middleware.

### Sensitive Data

If you have sensitive data you'd like to prevent from being sent to the Metrics
API via headers, query params or payload bodies, you can specify a list of keys
to filter via the `reject_params` option. Key-value pairs matching these keys
will not be included in the request to the Metrics API.

You are also able to specify a set of `allow_only` which should only be sent through.
Any header or body values not matching these keys will be filtered out and not
send to the API.

You may only specify either `reject_params` or `allow_only` keys, not both.

### Rails

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb or config/environments/production.rb
require "readme/metrics"

options = {
  api_key: "<<apiKey>>",
  development: false,
  reject_params: ["not_included", "dont_send"],
  buffer_length: 5,
}

config.middleware.use Readme::Metrics, options do |env|
  current_user = env['warden'].authenticate

  if current_user.present?
    {
      api_key: current_user.api_key, # Not the same as the ReadMe API Key
      label: current_user.name,
      email: current_user.email
    }
  else
    {
      api_key: "guest",
      label: "Guest User",
      email: "guest@example.com"
    }
  end
end
```

### Rack

```ruby
# config.ru
options = {
  api_key: "<<apiKey>>",
  development: false,
  reject_params: ["not_included", "dont_send"]
}

use Readme::Metrics, options do |env|
    {
      api_key: "owlbert_api_key"
      label: "Owlbert",
      email: "owlbert@example.com"
    }
end

run YourApp.new
```
