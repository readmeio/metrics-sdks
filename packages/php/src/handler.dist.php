     * a unique identifier for the callee (session ID, user ID, etc.).
     *
     * Optionally, you may also return the following:
     *
     *  - `label`: This will be used to identify the user on ReadMe, since it's
     *      much easier to remember a name than a unique identifier.
     *  - `email`: Email of the person that is making the call.
