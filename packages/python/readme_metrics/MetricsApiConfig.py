    """ReadMe Metrics API configuration object

    Attributes:
        README_API_KEY (str): (required) Your ReadMe API key
        GROUPING_FUNCTION (lambda): (required) Grouping function to construct an
            identity object. It receives the current request as a parameter, and must
            return a dictionary containing at least an "id" field, and optionally
            "label" and "email" fields.

            The main purpose of the identity object is to identify the API's caller.
        BUFFER_LENGTH (int, optional): Number of requests to buffer before sending data
            to ReadMe. Defaults to 10.
        IS_DEVELOPMENT_MODE (bool, optional): Determines whether you are running in
            development mode. Defaults to False.
        IS_BACKGROUND_MODE (bool, optional):  Determines whether to issue the call to
            the ReadMe API in a background thread. Defaults to True.
        BLACKLIST (List[str], optional): An array of headers and JSON body properties to
            skip sending to ReadMe.

            If you configure a blacklist, it will override any whitelist configuration.
        WHITELIST (List[str], optional): An array of headers and JSON body properties to
            send to ReadMe.

            If this option is configured, ONLY the whitelisted properties will be sent.
