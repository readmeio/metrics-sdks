## Installation

```
npm install readmeio
```

## Usage

Just add the middleware to express, and that's it!

```javascript
const readme = require('readmeio');

app.use(readme.metrics('<<apiKey>>', req => ({
  id: req.project._id,
  label: req.project.name,
  email: req.project.owner
})));
```

### Limitations
- Currently only supports JSON request bodies. Adding a whitelist/blacklist for non-JSON bodies will not work (unless they're added to `req.body`) the same way that `body-parser` does it. The properties will be passed into [`postData`](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#postData) as a `params` array.
- Needs more support for getting URLs when behind a reverse proxy: `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto`, etc.
- Needs more support for getting client IP address when behind a reverse proxy.
- Logs are "fire and forget" to the metrics server, so any failed requests (even for incorrect API key!) will currently fail silently.
